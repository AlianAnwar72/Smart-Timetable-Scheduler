# Timetable Scheduler â€“ AI Project

## Overview
The **Timetable Scheduler** is an AI-based schedule optimization tool that uses a **Genetic Algorithm** to efficiently generate conflict-free and optimized timetables. It ensures fair allocation of resources, minimizes scheduling conflicts, and optimizes time slots for better utilization.

## Features
- Genetic algorithm-based timetable optimization
- Conflict-free schedule generation
- Efficient allocation of resources and time slots
- Data handling and processing with **Pandas**
- Computational operations with **NumPy**

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**

## Usage
- Input your timetable data (e.g., courses, rooms, timeslots, faculty).
- Run the scheduler to generate an optimized timetable.
- Review and export the generated timetable.
